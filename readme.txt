Easily allow your readers to get new posts by email (automatically).

== Description ==

This free plugin makes it easy for people to follow your blog. Simply install it and place a subscription form or subscription icons on your site and then people can subscribe already. 

The plugin is based on the service Specificfeeds.com. When you publish a new post, the SpecificFeeds-servers get pinged from the plugin so that we know there is a new story. We then send the story to all users who subscribed. 

You can access all information about your subscribers (e.g. emails, statistics) if you connect your feed to a SpecificFeeds account (third step in the plugin). 

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and drop the contents into the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation. Then activate the plugin from the plugins page.

Then go to plugin settings page and answer the 3 questions as shown on the screen. That's it. 

Note: This plugin requires CURL to be activated/installed on your server (which should be the standard case). If you don't have it, please contact your hosting provider.
